# w0rp's Linux GCC smokeqt build guide

Install the latest Qt 4.8 (or whatever you want) via your package manager.

Install CMake.

You'll be running dealing with libraries you compiled yourself, so
make sure that the directory is in your path, e.g.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
```

Clone the smoke repositories.

```bash
git clone git://anongit.kde.org/smokegen
git clone git://anongit.kde.org/smokeqt
```

Build smokegen.

```bash
cd smokegen
cmake .
make
```

Now install everything that was built. (Run as root)

```bash
make install
```

Run cmake again in the smokeqt directory.

```bash
cd ..\smokeqt
cmake .
make
```

If you get an error about cppwrapper.so being missing, that means
you need to update your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include it. Look at the
output of `make install` for smokegen to find out where it puts it.

Now install everything that was built.

```bash
make install
```
